# SLSA-demo

This is a very simple demo repo that contains a simnple spring app, and uses a modified version of this [workflow](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/generic/README.md) to generate provenance. The provenance is uploaded as a build artifact.

See the modified workflow [here](https://github.com/toddbaert/SLSA-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/slsa-build.yaml).
